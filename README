Patchset policy:

A patch can be added to the patchset if either:
1) It solves a critical security fix and no new PHP release is in sight
2) It solves a Gentoo specific issue such as default paths, --as-needed etc

This means specifically that the patchset can not contain patches that adds new features or behaviour not supported by upstream.

If you require such patches, we provide an alternative:
1. Create the directory /etc/portage/patches/dev-lang/php
2. Drop any patches you would like to apply to PHP in said directory
3. emerge php

This will apply your patches to PHP after the ebuild has applied the Gentoo patchset.
